Style adoped in these programs. 

-----------------------------------------------
Include files: 
Add #ifndef statements at the top of all include files. Stick with name convention. 
If the include file is named abc.h, you should add: 
#ifndef __ABC_H__
#define ___ABC_H__
...
...
#endif
-----------------------------------------------
Classes should be capitalized. 
Multi-syllable words should have capitals on each syllable. (there are exceptions)
All non-standard types should be defined in typedefs.h via typedefs
---------------------------------------------
Method names in classes start with a non-capital letter; following syllables are capitalized
Variable names are all lower-case, with words separated by underscore. 

Try to document as you go.
