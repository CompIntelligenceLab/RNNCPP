- How to incorporate frozen weights? 
- Create a library to link against (Cmakefile): Nathan
- Weight initialization
- Create single layer feedforward and print out the outputs
- create a code to run all the tests at once and provide a method
to determine success or failure. 

- Need to implement a deep copy assignment operator for the Optimzer class. The
  Model class' copy constructor uses the following line...
    *optimizer = *m.optimizer;
- add to layer: pre-activation values. So postactivation is simply the application of one function
  This is the "inputs" member variable. 
- Create 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Features: 
VF1D_F loss;  // different batches stored at different locations

Implemented a function to generate a sine wave. Returns VF2D (x,y)

User is currently responsible for shaping the function to use as required
for a particular application. Specialized routines might  be made available.

- Create a Weight class for increased flexibility.  (done)
- Can create subclasses for specialized layers. 
- In the future, layer classes can be templatized by weight type. 
- is it possible to derive a activation function f(x) such that: 
     x(t) = f(x(t-tau)) ? if so, we can do delays with back propagation. 
	 Assume eps=tau << 1
	 x(t) = f(x(t) - eps xdot(t)) = f(x(t)) - eps dfdx(x(t)) * xdot(t)
	 x = f - eps f' xdot
