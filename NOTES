*** the model should have a variable called global loss, which the sum of individual loss that are collected. 

One takes the derivative of the sum of losses over the sequences with respect to the weights. Is that correct?

Backpropagation works with recurrent nets!
Next: biases. Then GMM! Then LSTM!

One bias per node. Consider a single layer.

Input layer: 3
Output layer: 5
Weight: 5 x 3
Number biases: 5
Add another column to w
Now Weight: 5 x 4
So add unit component to the "a" layer output and 1 column to the weights:  
  z* = w* * a*   (w* has additional column, a* has a unit component). z* has the 
  same number of rows as before. 

The disadvantage of storing weights the way we do, via pointers (if biases are incorporated into the weights), 
is that one MUST share weights+biases at the same time. One cannot just share the weights and keep the biases individual. 
That is a RESTRICTION OF OUR APPROACH. 

Better though: the bias is a property of the layer. If a layer L1 has 128 nodes, 
and two layers L2 and L3, of size 512 impinge on L1, there are are still only 128 biases in L1, 
512 biases in L2 and another 512 biases in L3. 
So we'll store the biases with the layers. 

I will want to consider the biases to be on or off. Not clear how to do this. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bias derivatives work for test_recurrent_model_bias2.cpp (2 recurrent nodes). 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
My guess: there is still a small error somewhere in the 3rd or 4th significant digit. Do not know where. 
So, TODO: 
- remove all print statements. 
- remove unused methods
- keep only the most general routines for recursion + weight updates with bias.

At this time, the Connection class has "WEIGHT weight" member variable, making it difficult to share weights between pointers. 
To do so (share weights), it would be be better if this member were a WEIGHT* weight; I must now change all locations in the code
using WEIGHT. 
If the I did not have a special typedef for weights, it would much hard to identify all the locations where change was required in the code. 
This little tidbit is for Nathan who complained one day about all the different typedefs to remember.

Storing of data in Armadillo is columnwise. So I am storing weight as w(seq, dim), so matrix products w*x are efficient. However, 
w(2,5), follows w(1,5) in memory, like Fortran. Therefore, w(dim, seq) would be more efficient, and the matrix product should be x*w
instead of w*x, with x a row vector. TODO IN THE FUTURE. softmax would be cheaper as well since one must sum over dimensions to 
compute the denominator. However, ignore until total cost of program is diagnosed. 

VF2D_F variables are stored as x[batch](dimension, seq). So summing over dimensions is equivalent to summing over one column, as it should
be for efficiency. 

Now consider the derivatives. 
a = f(z) where a and z have dimension "layer_size". For scalar activation functions, one computes the gradient da/dz = f'
But for vector functions (such as the softmax), da/dz = J = jacobian of the transformation, which is a (layer_size X layer_size) matrix. 
Thus, the deltas dL/da(l) (l is the layer), is written as wght * (J * dL/da(l))
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sep. 4, 2016
Consider: 
dL/da(l) = dL/da(l+1) * da(l+1)/dz(l+1) * dz(l+1)/da(l+1)
dL/da(l)(k) = dL/da(l+1)(p) * da(l+1)(p)/dz(l+1)(q) * dz(l+1)(q)/da(l)(k)
Given that: 
z(l+1)(q) = w(q,j) * a(l)(j), 
dz(l+1)(q)/da(l)(k) = w(q,j) * delta(k,j)  (Kronecker delta)
                      w(q,k) (Kronecker delta) (ignore layer indices)
We also have: 
da(l+1)(p)/dz(l+1)(q) = J(l+1)(p,q) = Jacobian of activation function 

Collecting and combining the above relations: 
dL/da(l)(k) = dL/da(l+1)(p) * J(l+1)(p,q) * w(q,k)
Need Jacobian of activation function

Question: Consider a connection from a layer to itself. should the layers contain the connection information, 
or should be considered a connection like any other connection? 
- Any other connection:  more consistent with the rest of the program
- Keeping the connection with the layer: the layer, if recurrent contains this connection and can treat it polymorphically. 
  However, the general code becomes more complex. What is the difference between a connection going from layers L1 to L1 with a 
  delay of 2 and a onnection going from layer L1 to layer L2 with a connection of 2? Shouldn't their treatment be identical? 
- Also, how do LSTM's work? They have internal connections that are a part of the LSTM (they form in a sense a "complex" nodes. 
  In fact, these complex nodes can be thought of as a model in themselves. either the single LSTM could be a Model, or a layer of 
  LSTMs could be a model (probably better, especially if the weihgts of different LSTMs within a layer are connected (as they are, in 
  Keras, for example.)

Demonstrate making a change in common.cpp and recompiling as an example of why implementations should not be included in a file. 
Rather they should be in a class. Compilation takes too long. if only the .h file is included, long compilations only occur when the .h
file is changed, which happens less often than changes in the implementation cpp file.

t_from = 0

t_ : initially set to t_from, incremented every iteration. When t_ == t_to,

Weights are initialized as w(input, output), but are stored as w(output, input). 
That is very confusing. At some point, I should change this so that weight 
are initialized as w(output, input). 

So if I define w1 = WEIGHT(3,5) and w = WEIGHT(5,7), 
the multiplication w1*w does not work, but w*w1 does. 

I am afraid that there are too many places to change in the code!

test_diff_eq4: set certain connections to temporal manually to make it easier to 
create clist() for the spatial connections. clist is normally constructed by connectionOrderCleanOrig. Contrary to what I thought, this routine cannot handle all cases. So let us ignore connections already identified as temporal. 

Perhaps I need to keep the temporal links in a separate list from the spatial links, 
and include in this list all the temporal links from the RecurrentLayers. This might 
actually simplify things. 

Of course, this manual approach will make it hard to handle reservoir networks, unless all the connections are treated as temporal. 

Create a new branch called temporal to deal with this problem.

Figured the error out: recurrent layers have a temporal connection. In the new code, 
the temporal connections are contained in Model::clist_temporal. So I must change initialize_weights
to initialize the recucrrent connections correctly. 

I need a way to initialize weight using a preestablished sequence of random or non-random numbers. Otherwise
it becomes hard to compare multiple codes with each other. Alternatively, how to I initiate a random 
stream?

diff_eq5: with Tanh on the 2nd node. 
seq_len = 5 and 10: the alpha goes to 2.04 and 1.857, respectively. Why isn't the 
convergence to the same value? But why should it be since the network is different, and 
does not match the discretization of a differential equation. 

When I freeze only the two weights that have constraints on them, the weight from first to second
node converges to 66, which is rather large. Do not know why. I need to visualize the intermediate inputs. 
Note that the tanh squashes the solution, removing the effect of the large weihgt. so in Neural 
networks, what prevents the weights from growing too large?

I do get convergence for the two-node case, but the loss function is not decreasing. 

The loss function goes down during an epoch, but then goes up before decreasing again (when there are two nodes
in the network: DecayDE and Tanh). So ultimately, I believe that after reaching some minimum, the loss function
increases and the system goes into some other steady state, that is not consistent with the desired solution of 
the differential equation. To confirm this, I must run the prediction routine (with seq_len=1 and stateful=True).

Clip gradient of cross-entropy to [-5,5]. Same as char-rnn. 
Perhaps I need ReLU instead of Tanh?

Loss function appears incorrect in char-rnn. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 18, 2016
I cannot share activations between layers because they are deleted by the layer destructor. 
Better solution is to use auto_ptrs or something like that. 

I am running category classification with 2 classes. I find that the loss function first decreases from 9 to 0.001 in a few 
epochs, then returns back to its original value and oscillations. The lr is constant = 0.01. Still, kind of strange. 

A lr of 0.1 makes the loss oscillate. A loss of 0.01 makes loss go from 2.26 to 0.40 and then stays at 0.4 .  A loss of 0.001 makes loss
go towards 4.04 monotonically. Batch = 400

Batch = 32: loss (lr=0.001) eventually oscillates between 1.04 and 0.43 . So minimum is different than with larger batch. 

Initial Weight rms = .01  did not work
Initial Weight rms = .1  worked.

char-rnn seems to converge (loss function decreasing). 
Some notes: Using ReLU, seq_len=25, batch=1: with lr=.1 and lr=.001 (using char-rnn.py from Karpathy as reference)
    Convergence is much faster with lr=.1 as expected
Using ReLU, seq_len=25, batch=64: with lr=.001 (code convergences slowly)
Using ReLU, seq_len=25, batch=64: with lr=.1 (NaNs develop rather quickly)

Make sure learning_rate in Objective.h and other classes, matches that of model (by default)

MUST FIX BUG THAT PREVENTS Creation of 2 models!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 20, 2016
char-rnn: ReLU: nans. Tanh: no Nans. Do not follow. I am using one recursive layer. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 21, 2016
Now that I fixed a bug in Cross-Entropy (I must call Softmax in both Cross-Entropy and Gradient, which I had not done), 
the categorical 2-class classification no longer works. No idea why. Perhaps it is related to the Globals class? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 21, 2016
char-rnn works with seq=1, batch=1, same parameters as Karpathy. Karpathy's converges in 400 iteration, mine in 2000 iterations. fox.txt is long enough that we stay within a single epoch. 

With seq_len=5, Karpathy converges in 60 iterations (400 iterations with seq_len=1). 

I find that derivative matrix dWxh differs from Karpathy, whereas, 
dWhy does not.  WHY?
dbh is incorrect, dby is correct (last layer)

dy = dL/dy   (loss function gradient) (ok)
dh = np.dot(Why.T, dy) (ok)
dhraw = (1-hs[t]*hs[t]) * dh  (ok)
dbh += dhraw (ok)

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS: 
char_rnn.cpp crashes with layer_size = 2. WHY?  (line 203?)
 Some kind of memory problem
dWxh and dbh are incorrect. 
dbh -> frozen is not initialized properly. That will create problems. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 22, 2016
It is hard to understand how RNNCPP was working before if now
I have problems with bias and weight deltas (derivatives) in the 
first layers (even though their values in the final layer are correct.)
Perhaps because I was only checking special cases 

The error is in routine: 
    void Connection::gradMulDLda(int ti_from, int ti_to)

I am going around in circles.The error (compared to char-nn.py) is in the last layer before the loss function. dWhy (where W is h-y connection)
and dby are incorrect. dWxh and dbh are correct. 

I did not change anything, and the codes now agree with each other. Somewhat bothersome. Now check whh. 

FIGURED IT OUT: the input layer has a bias. I do not know whether this 
impacts the results. Should not. 

1st iteration works. 

TODO next: figure out why there is an error on the second iteration, 
which is not reasonable. Must have to do with the state? 
Among other things, dWhh != 0 (even though =0 at 1st iteration).
In my code, dWhh is zero at iteration 2. WHY? That is likely wrong. 

Once the code works with seq_len=1 and multiple iterations, check 
the code for seq_len > 1. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 23, 2016
- Fixed one error: I had forgotten to update weight transposes after the 
weight update. 
NEXT: I must fix temporal weight update, which is non-zero even if sequence = 1, at least at the 2nd iteration. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 24, 2016
- Prediction is correct for several iterations. 
- Backprop somehow not taking into account incoming h(s)

Made progress. 
iterations 0 and 1, inputs/outputs seem ok. 
Iteration 2: h layer input: 0.0966 vs 0.0976  (SOMETHING WRONG). 
So look at previous iteration to find error. 
EVERYTHING looks identical between the codes for 2 iterations. 
So why would iteration 3 be different? MAKES NO SENSE!!

Last error: I must take the previous state into account in the prediction stage. 
Layer::forwardLoop: added a condition dealing with previous_state. Did 
not work. Something still missing. The changes were minimal. Not enough to match-up.

QUESTION: when backprop is turned off: I get perfect match between me and Karpathy. WHY? And there is no difference when I turn on or off my changes to fowardLoop in Layers::forwardLoop. That does not make any sense. So my problems still lie with the backprop. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 25, 2016
- Even though I am saving prev_state, its effect is not felt in prediction 
phase, and this is clearly not correct. 
- prediction works for 3 iterations. 
- Backprop: wrong inputs at iteration 1. Indictes that I must be 
adding prediction values twice somehow. LOOK INTO IT. 
Iteration 0: bh and dWxh are incorrect. They should be: 
     0.009849 and [0.009849 0 0 0 0] respectively. 

old_deriv for (input-d1)->layer_to->getDelta is zero (should not be), even 
at t=0 .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 25, 2016
- dbh (bias delta) is zero in my code, is -.009849 in Karpathy code. 
  dbh=(1-hs**2)*dh  [[-0.00984931]]
-dWxh should be 
  dWxh=  [[-0.00984931  0.          0.          0.          0.        ]]

This is already happening at iteration zero!  This is layer 1 (getLayers()[1])

Success: codes match for seq_len=1, layer_size = 1, batch_size = 1, and 5 iterations. 

TODO: seq_len > 1, layer_size > 1. 

First result: layer_size=1, seq_len=2 DOES NOT WORK. 
seq_len=1, layer_size=2: segmentation error in my code. 

SO BAD NEWS ALL AROUND. 

Possible error when seq_len > 1: look into connections.cpp, line 361. 
Looks like Code matches Karpathy for layers_size = 2 (and probably > 2). 

Next, investigate seq_len > 1. Look at connections.cpp 
(TRY THIS TOMORROW). 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 26, 2016
- Step 1: prediction only. 

From ge.py (Karpathy), I notice that in backprop, the only place that 
stateful is used is: 
dWhh += np.dot(dhraw, hs[t-1].T)   which is a temporal link. 

Set Why = 0 (to simplify equations)

I now set all weights to zero, and find that the bias deltas are off
by a factor of 3. They are three times larger in Karpathy's code. No 
idea why as yet. 

Problem solved: I was dividing the gradient by seq_len (so that the learning
rate would not have to change). Karpathy did not do this averaging. I removed
the averaging during the debugging process. Might add it back later. 

With all weights = 0 and seq=3, I get perfect match with Karpathy for 5 iterations. 
NEXT: set wxh to nonzero. Results: after 4 iterations: only 6 significant
digit accuracy. This would imply some kind of error (but slight), although errors
are accumulating slowly. SHOULD FIX. 

When I added non-zero, I retain 6 significant digit accuracy. 
When I added why non-zero, I decrease to 4 significant digit accuracy. 

THERE IS A SLIGHT ERROR SOMEWHERE. 

20 iterations: I maintain 4 significant digits. 
200 iterations: no more significant digits. 

I BELIEVE I MUST FIND THE ERROR. 

At iter=0, discrepency only in: 
Karpathy code (seq_len=2)
dWxh=  [[ 0.0002205   0.03667871  0.          0.          0.        ]]
weight delta (my code)
-0.009981685548 0.03667870705 0 0 0
Other error: dWhh is 0 in my code. 

HOW IS THIS REALLY POSSIBLE? 
I removed Whh (set to zero). At iter=0, I get: 
dWxh=  [[-0.00984931  0.03729054  0.          0.          0.        ]]
weight delta
-0.0099838936397 0.037290544237 0 0 0
The first argument is MUCH closer. Remove another weight, say Wxh=0
my code: -0.013145913964 0.037 0 0 0
Karpathy: -0.13 0.037 0 0 0    
WHY THE DIFFERENCE? 
Problem: line 925 of char-rnn.cpp
		clist_temporal[c]->dLossDOutput(t, t-1, prt); // TEMPORARY GE
		in module: void Model::storeDActivationDOutputInLayersRecCon(int t)

Corrected a problem: I hd forgotten a weight transpose in CreateModel
I know get 6 decimal place accuracy. 

Still small problem. 
In Karpathy: dWhh is non-zero at iteration 1 at each of the two sequence indexes. 
In my code, dWhh is zero at iteration 1, and is only non-zero at iteration 2. 
Clearly an error. 

According to me, dWhh should be zero after 1 iteration, because prev_state is zero for iter=0 and iter=1 under the experimental conditions chosen. I am not following. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 27, 2016
I get 8 digit match with Karpathy for 200 iterations. My problem was 
a small error in    void Connection::dLossDWeight(int t, bool prnt=false)
in the temporal link. My times were off by one. 
//delta = (old_deriv[b].col(t+1) % grad[b].col(t+1)) * out_t.row(t);  // orig
delta = (old_deriv[b].col(t) % grad[b].col(t)) * out_t.row(t-1);
// (notice the time arguments). This is a temporal link. 

Removed print statements from Connections. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 27, 2016
I get the same results as Karpathy, but not when I start sampling with the real 
random numbers. In Karpathy, the softmax goes a a Dirac function after 100 iterations, and that is not the case for me. WHY? Something wrong with my second model? The one with seq_len=batch_len=1? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 27, 2016, 9:30 am
Char-rnn.cpp now works!! Same results as Karpathy!
Make sure I save the previous state in sample(). It is set in trainOneBatch, but 
not when calling predict...(). That is why I had to reset it manually.
When using trainOneBatch, the state is saved AFTER the backpropagation. Ideally, 
I would like to save it after the prediction phase, but if I do that, the backprop
will use the new saved state in its algorithm instead of the previous saved state. 
I could have an more and and less recent saved state, but I really doubt that is how this should be done. 

With ReLU, brown converges by iter=50 with no errors after that. With Tanh,
convergence is much slower, with sporadic errors up until iter=1000. 
SGD only. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dec. 27, 2016, 12:20 pm
Here is the solution to the stateful problem. Put it at the beginning of 
predict. Simply place the last sequence element into previousState. 

Top of ::predict
	if (stateful == false) {
		resetState(); 
  // INSERT saving of predicted state. 
  // Assumes that state is clean before first call to predict.

gmm1d sampling appears to work. 
Not sure about gradient calculation. How to check?

- fixed derivatives of gmm objective function in src/objective.cpp. 
- if initial weights have rms=.01 (random), the normal distributions stay too close to each other. 
If initial weights have rms=.3, I get nans. So I set initial weight rms to .1 . Code works without 
nans. Whether it works properly or not remains to be seen. 

GMM1D seems to work, using SGD. However, even though stochastics are different every run,
I would expect the mean, std, and pi to have the same values given the fact the the signal 
is constant. 

A nice thing is that the curves of mean, std and pi are periodic. 8 oscillations per 100 steps. 
However, the original sine wave has 1.25 oscillations per 100 steps. This might be related
to the fact that pi,mu,sig have size seq_len, which I did not take into account when output
the data. 

When I try Adagrad, it is unstable unless I decrease the learning rate. Do not know why there is a 
problem. It eventually becomes stable, but the rms, mean, pi do not oscillate nearly as cleanly as 
when using SGD.  DO NOT KNOW WHY. I should try "generating" a signal. With a simple sign wave, I would expect the pdf to have very small sigma and be almost dirac-like if I expect a good signal reconstruction.

I ran runtest(), and found that derivatives dL/dw are not correct (fdinc=0.001). 
I should test derivative of loss function and compare to its gradient. There is probably an error. 

With nb GMMs = 1, derivatives are exactly double the value computed via computeGradient. The derivatives with respect to std are incorrect. 

Fixed derivative wrt means. (I had forgotten factor 1/2 in Normal pdf).

dL/dW works with a single GMM. dL/dy does not work with two GMMs (6 nodes in layer). No idea why. Once DL/dy is correct, dL/dW will work. 
Derivatives dL/dW and DL/db are correct I should try generating the sine wave. Results are better than before, but still not good
enough. 

The gradient of GMM wrt (mu,pi,sig) has the wrong sign!!! How can this be? 

gmm1d works. I create a crappy sine wave. Whether it can be improved or not remains to be seen. Perhaps I must add additional information  to the curve (as is done by A. Graves, who adds a component stating whether or not the pen is down, when generating handwriting. Perhaps I should have 2D input: function + derivative, although sequence should take care of that. 
Perhaps I should create a LSTM next.
