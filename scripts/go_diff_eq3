# Real test of parameter estimation to determine differential equation from a network. 

# nsl 0 means there is no nodes in the series section of the network
# this network will have a single recurrent node

# -sl:  serial layers: standard configuration for deep networks: one layer follows the other towards the loss function. 
# -pl:  parallel layers: Input is connected to multiple layers, each one a deep network, and connected at the loss function. 

# if seq_len = 1, -r should have no effect
