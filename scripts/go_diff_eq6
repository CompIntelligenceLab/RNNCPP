# Real test of parameter estimation to determine differential equation from a network. 

# nsl 0 means there is no nodes in the series section of the network
# this network will have a single recurrent node 

build/tests/test_diff_eq6/test_diff_eq6 -l 1 -npl 1 -nsl 0  -b 1 -s 20 -a "decayde" -r 1 -w "identity" -i 1.e-2 -e 5000 -lr .01

# -sl:  serial layers: standard configuration for deep networks: one layer follows the other towards the loss function. 
# -pl:  parallel layers: Input is connected to multiple layers, each one a deep network, and connected at the loss function. 
# -e: nb_epochs

# if seq_len = 1, -r should have no effect
